"Story":
	You play as Merkules.  He was adventuring in the high seas when out of seemingly nowhere, 
	his ship is destroyed.  Fortunately, he meets Megami the mergirl who gives him both spears
	for the sharks and the ability to breath underwater.  Upon reaching the beach, he finds 
	the dying Sir Imerton, a dragoon who was on a quest to save the last dragoon soul from the
	keep of Lord Raucent, a legendary dragoon himself.  Sir Imerton was shanked by the thief 
	Ryse in his quest for shinies kept at the keep.  With his dying breath, Sir Imerton gives 
	Merkules the axe of Anthon the Great, who was thought to have died in the galkan resistance, 
	and tasks him with protecting the dragoon soul. In the next level, Merkules must contend
	with the clones of Ryse, left behind to cover his tracks.  Upon reaching the castle, Merkules
	finds the dragoon soul and is granted the ability to fly.  The Archmage Sonderon greets him
	and grants him the ability to use a fireball because "it only seems fitting for a dragon".
	In the third stage, Merkules must contend with the bard, Fara, who has been tasked with
	protecting the castle from intruders. 
	Upon death, Merkules can offer up a ginger cookie to Terabera, a healer who then revives him.
	
	"Easter egg": while making game a funny glitch happened with the movement of "decoration fishie",
		which was maintained in both the splash screen (fish flipping across the screen) and in level 1
		there is a fish which falls down a set of tiles (all other fish swim back and forth). This fish
		is named Sir Fishington IV.
	
Description:
	General:
		Player has 3 lives (can die 4 times before game over), represented as "ginger cookies"
		Player has 70 hit points (when hit at 0 player dies and loses a life)
			HP is represented as a single ginger cookie, player consumes one part to restore health
			when hit and so icon loses a chunk when hit (hence why a life uses one cookie upon respawn:
			player has eaten all of the current cookie)
		Current weapon, hp, and number of lives are displayed in the upper right corner of the screen
		Score is based upon number of kills and number of deaths.
			Each kill (regardless of enemy type or method) adds 100 points to score
			Each player death subtracts 50 points from score
		Players and enemies all animated using sprite sheets.
		Box2D is used for movement (adding forces/impulses for weapons/player/enemies) and collision detection.

Sprites:
	Done by Brandon Merkley:
		SelfSprite (Fara), Player Sprite (Merkules), Enemies (Shark, Ryse Clones(ninjas), Fara (bards)), overworld tiles,
		'decoration fishie', coral, talons, dragon wings, friendly sprites (Terabera, Anthon)
	Done by myself:
		Sir Imerton (based on Kain from FF4, recolored to a dark purple and added beard)
		Archmage Sonderon (based on black mage from FF1, recolored to red and added fireball)
		Fireball, Axe, Throwing Dagger, Spears, ocean/forest/castle tiles, background for ocean/forest/castle 
		
	Self sprite is based on my FFXIV character, picture (FILE) is saved as part of project.
	Documentation for spriting also attached. I tried to maintain a record of the process as a lot of the spriting
		was done over skype using screenshare during the process (after I sent Brandon initial designs)
