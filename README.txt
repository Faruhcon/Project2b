I have included the entire game folder I've been using to develop the game in this submission.
	You will need everything within the impact folder to run the game. You do not need the other folders/files

I have uploaded a public repo (link below) which contains a baked version of the game.
	To run this version, you will need the entire media folder, index.html, and game.min.js
	Make sure that both of the files and the media folder are in the same base directory or game will not run
In addition, I have made a demo page for the game that should run without needed to download/install anything
